-- For a given location and week, get details of all the teamsâ€™ formations recorded in the
-- system. Details include, head coach first name and last name, start time of the training
-- or game session, address of the session, nature of the session (training or game), the
-- teams name, the score (if the session is in the future, then score will be null), and the
-- first name, last name and role (goalkeeper, defender, etc.) of every player in the team.
-- Results should be displayed sorted in ascending order by the start day then by the start
-- time of the session. 

-- PARAMS: location_id, week_number

-- Step 1: Get the list of all teams for a given location and week

-- define params for location_id and week_number
SET @location_id = 1;-- Step 0: Define parameters (remove if running on a system that doesn't support SET)

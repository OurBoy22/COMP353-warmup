Triggers that we need

- Check Age Range 11 to 18 - First day of each month check if any club member turned 18 last month 
-> deactivate membership and send email of deactivation

- Check if member is associated to only one location, when they move to a different branch

- Check if membership fees are paid, if not set that member to Inactive.

- Check if all members are same genders in Teams. So when a member gets added

- Check if a players has been assigned to 2 team formation on the same day, 
    there has to be at least a 3h difference between the start time of the two formations.

- Every week on sunday, check for games in the upcoming week, the system should send an email to every club member 
    indicating the schedule of the session including date, time, address, name of head coach, and email of the head coach.

Project description Notes

example: “Montréal Youth Group 6 Monday 20-Feb-2024 6:00 PM training session”. The email
body should include the club member’s first name, last name and role in the game (outside hitter,
opposite, setter, middle blocker, libero, defensive specialist, or serving specialist), the first-name,
last-name and email address of the captain of the session, whether the session is a training session

-- Get a report on all active club members who have only been assigned as outside hitter
-- in all the formation team sessions they have been assigned to. They must be assigned
-- to at least one formation session as an outside hitter. They should have never been
-- assigned to any formation session with a role different than outside hitter. The list
-- should include the club memberâ€™s membership number, first name, last name, age,
-- phone number, email and current location name. The results should be displayed sorted
-- in ascending order by location name then by club membership number.

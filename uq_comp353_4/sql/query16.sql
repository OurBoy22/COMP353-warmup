-- Get a report of all active club members who have never lost a game in which they
-- played. A club member is considered to win a game if she/he has been assigned to a
-- game session and is assigned to the team that has a score higher than the score of the
-- other team. The club member must be assigned to at least one formation game session.
-- The list should include the club memberâ€™s membership number, first name, last name,
-- age, phone number, email and current location name. The results should be displayed
-- sorted in ascending order by location name then by club membership number.
